# Function-Based Image Representation (Concept Note)

## Overview
This concept proposes a novel image storage and representation paradigm:  
Instead of storing raw pixel values, a mathematical function **f(r, g, b, l)** is fitted to the RAW image data,  
capturing color response, contrast behavior, and luminance in a continuous form.

## Goals
- Achieve **infinite resolution** (scaling without blurring) within the bounds of the original RAW data.
- Reduce storage by representing images as **fitted functional structures**, not pixel matrices.
- Treat images as **mathematical constructs** rather than raster snapshots.

## Core Idea
- Use RAW image pixel data to fit a continuous function `f(r, g, b, l)` (or its variant forms with spatial parameters).
- This function defines color output or transformation behavior across the spatial domain.
- When rendering, compute pixel values dynamically from the function, rather than reading fixed data.

## Potential Benefits
- Extreme storage reduction with high-fidelity reconstruction.
- Lossless infinite zoom within the capture resolution.
- Unique signature for each image based on its functional parameters.
- New foundation for next-generation image formats and generative systems.

## Next Steps (To Be Discussed)
- Define the precise input domain: `(r, g, b, l)` or include `(x, y)` coordinates?
- Choose function types: polynomial basis, Fourier, neural networks?
- Develop fitting algorithms for high-resolution RAW data.
- Explore hybrid models with region-based local functions.
