# Voltage-Selective RGB Photon Emission Panel

This project explores a speculative nanostructured light-emission panel designed to emit controlled red, green, and blue light through voltage-specific activation of layered electroluminescent materials.

It forms a critical component of the broader [Light_Matrix_Compute_Wander](https://github.com/YukiyamaShizuka/Light_Matrix_Compute_Wander) framework for atom-resonant, frequency-routed computing.

## Concept Overview

The panel consists of **three nanometer-scale emissive layers**, each producing a distinct wavelength:

- **Top Layer**: Red-emissive
- **Middle Layer**: Green-emissive
- **Bottom Layer**: Blue-emissive

Each layer is:
- Coupled with a transparent, nanoscale electrode mesh
- Addressed by voltage-selective node activation
- Patterned with **concave microstructures** to focus emitted photons and reduce dispersion

---

## Key Features

- **Voltage-Controlled Color Emission**: Specific voltages excite only one of the RGB layers
- **Layered Photon Emission**: Each layer is spectrally isolated and vertically stacked
- **Nano-Scale Electrode Grids**: Allow precise regional activation and low cross-talk
- **Photonic Directionality**: Concave regions help concentrate light output to targeted zones

## Potential Applications

- **Optical bus systems** for on-chip frequency-based computing
- **Excitation source** for atom-resonant logic nodes
- **High-density, low-power displays**
- **Color-encoded ID routing interfaces**
